# Udacity-Data-Wrangling-with-MongoDB
This repo contains the quizzes and case study scripts for the Data Wrangling with MongoDB course

The quizzes or case study scripts are the python files (.py extension). Each file contains a description that talks about the quiz
or the goal of the script. Overall, the four main goals are: 
- Parsing data from variety of formats, including JSON, XML, CSV, XLS, and HTML
- Ensuring data quality by auditing validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
- Working with MongoDB and writing queries for MongoDB
- Analyzing data with aggregation pipeline and aggregation operations($match, $project, $unwind, $group) in MongoDB
